# COMP1004-WebPage

This is my COMP1004 single-web application.
It includes HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The topic is sleep management.
It was designed for all age groups to help manage their sleep better
As well as that, concerned parents or caregivers can check if a young one is getting the right amount of sleep, and what to do if they aren't
It includes causes and effects of lack of sleep, and tips to increase sleep time
If one is already getting enough sleep, there is also information on how to be consistant with it and the benefits it has for you.
As well as that, there is information for people who are getting too much sleep and suggestions on what they can do to handle it.

The main divs are AG-NES, AG-ES and TMS
AG stands for Age Group, e.g, AG2 = Age Group 2
NES stands for Not Enough Sleep
ES stands for Enough Sleep
TMS stands for Too Much Sleep
For each age group there is information on whether you are getting a lack of sleep, enough sleep, or too much sleep.
A user selects their age and average amount of sleep they get. Once they press submit, the page will independantly scroll to the div containing the relevant information to those choices.

Most of the website is made up of the colours blue, purple and pink and that was done on purpose because those are the colours associated with sleep.
